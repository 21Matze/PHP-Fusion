What's new on this repository management?
---
The latest repository contains all the previous commits done by all the core developers.
- 9.01 is beta 1

New development version naming system
---
For each subsequent branch - Core Developers will vote for new branch name for the next release.
Steps will involve "Nomination". We will be following A-Z chronological method in the naming system.
The names can be picked from any names from Space elements. Nomination and polls will be voted on the official project forum.
Note that the public release may not reflect the name system in developer branch naming.

The number prefix behind each branch naming will be determined at MT's discretion on making public releases.

Infusions, Locale and Themes
---
We will be adding codes to new repositories, in which only master branch shall apply. If you need versioning to the packages here, please do it on your own personal account and submit the master and latest version to these repository.
