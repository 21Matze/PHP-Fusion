New Core Team Project Colloboration
====
The project colloboration is now available at https://github.com/orgs/php-fusion/projects/1
All issues are tied to the project for team colloboration, with assigned tasks based on volunteering effort or best person which has been closest tied to such issue. The Kanban cards are useful for fast turnover and clear monitoring of all task that blocks the project from being completed and we will work based on fixing that identified blockage.

All Core Developers are given Admin Access for Read and Write. So feel free to add any critical issues that is critical to address for the completion of the project. 

We will be preparing Andromeda for public launch as soon as the Kanban Cards are done.

New development version naming system
---
For each subsequent branch - Core Developers will vote for new branch name for the next release.
Steps will involve "Nomination". We will be following A-Z chronological method in the naming system.
The names can be picked from any names from Space elements. Nomination and polls will be voted on the official project forum.
Note that the public release may not reflect the name system in developer branch naming.

The number prefix behind each branch naming will be determined at MT's discretion on making public releases.

Infusions, Locale and Themes
---
We will be adding codes to new repositories, in which only master branch shall apply. If you need versioning to the packages here, please do it on your own personal account and submit the master and latest version to these repository.
