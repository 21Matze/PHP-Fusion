<h1>PHP-Fusion Defender</h1>

<h2><blockquote>Security, the most advanced of its kind, offered in any CMS in the world, yet.</blockquote></h2>
With its light weight management system, with the way you use it, the PHP-Fusion has always been uniquely immersive and easy to manage your content.
With PHP-Fusion and the conventional default method introduced to every PHP Developers, we have introduced a whole new way to ensure your system stays secured.
Until now, these methods have been defined by the PHP source code developers...

For PHP-Fusion Galaxy 9, we're introducing an entirely new sanitization interaction and a whole new dimension to the way we can do things.
For the first time along recognising a bad string, PHP-Fusion is also recognizing its types, allowing itself to automatically handle itself against
another code against 3rd party unknown bad variable unintended input, while escalating the way you will experience PHP-Fusion.

This is the next generation of form validation and sanitization, enabled automatically wherever it is required system wide.
The Defender works on any code that is networked within PHP-Fusion giving you shortcuts to the things you do frequently to secure your sanitization.

At the heart of the new PHP-Fusion 9, new functions are developed to react as validation sensors and fully integrated into the Defender engine which will measure the changes of
each and every input fields. These measurements are then combined with a pre-sanitized values from the sensors to provide fast, accurate and continous response and
enhance itself automatically with Themes to provide beautiful form feedback.

All single process is all done a fraction of a second.

The Defender, is a clear example of how applications and core software can be developed together to work in a singular experience.


<h2>PHP-Fusion Dynamics</h2>

With the introduction of Bootstrap responsive framework, a single website have been transformed to adapt and is capable to become a multi device platform.

For a truly powerful developing experience, we've developed an entirely new Dynamic field input technology deeply integrated into PHP-Fusion 9's architecture. 

To produce a rich User Interface experience within the lightweight profile, we've enhanced field creation simplicity that can be self transforming a piece of short code into a range of responsive fields that enables tools and interaction that have been impossibly before together with 3rd party solutions.

While a dynamic field inputs on other typical Content Management System require a developer to write ten or more lines of codes, the PHP-Fusion 9 can reach about the same in just a few words, and it can be customized just as quickly. This allows developer to create more distinct applications in just less than a tenth of what was required before.

 PHP-Fusion continues to transform the way can can do things on a new scale, and to adapt to any work done on PHP-Fusion, however invented and designed.
