<h1>PHP-Fusion Defender</h1>
PHP-Fusion Defender core is a powerful engine, providing you a 360 degree auto-validation of all user input fields, and featuring an extensive field sanitization library to handle all types of field validation within PHP-Fusion CMS. 

<h2><blockquote>Security, the most advanced of its kind, offered in any CMS in the world, yet.</blockquote></h2>

<strong> Defender in action</strong>
<p>
In verifying text fields, the defender will validate against censored words, special characters, addslashes, auto trim, auto parsing http:// if the field is missing url. Text fields are then subcategorized into the several types.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li> - Auto regex checks, length, suffix, and prefix checks.
<li>URL</li> - Auto regex checks, length, suffix and prefix checks.
<li>Nuber</li> - Checks whether it is a legitimate integer.
<li>Text</li> - Custom length, and regex checks, word censorship.
</ul>
<p>In addition, the defender also handles file and images uploads. The defender will screen your photo prior to upload, check filename conflicts, verify files mimetypes, and handles photo upload upon success and return the file and thumbnail path.<p>
</p>When these are validated, Defender will ensure fields are met with the strongest requirements and reformat your values with slashes and escaped quotes and returning that value to your MySQL database.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security guaranteed on your Website.</strong> Using the latest defender update will always ensure you enjoy a maximum protection on no matter how poor a program has been coded as long as input are vetted by Defender.</li>
<li><strong>Developers will find it extremely robust,</strong> versatile and easy to use in your development codes.</li>
<li><strong>Expandable</strong> Defender is coded to be modular on its own and can expand to run custom configurations, if there are new kinds of fields that arrives the web standard, such as biometrics validation, geo location validation, phone number, IP validation, and such as we step into the future.
