<h1>PHP-Fusion Defender</h1>

<h2><blockquote>Security, the most advanced of its kind, offered in any CMS in the world, yet.</blockquote></h2>
With its light weight management system, with the way you use it, the PHP-Fusion has always been uniquely immersive and easy to manage your content.
With PHP-Fusion and the conventional default method introduced to every PHP Developers, we have introduced a whole new way to ensure your system stays secured.
Until now, these methods have been defined by the PHP source code developers...

For PHP-Fusion Galaxy 9, we're introducing an entirely new sanitization interaction and a whole new dimension to the way we can do things.
For the first time along recognising a bad string, PHP-Fusion is also recognizing its types, allowing itself to automatically handle itself against
another code against 3rd party unknown bad variable unintended input, while escalating the way you will experience PHP-Fusion.

This is the next generation of form validation and sanitization, enabled automatically wherever it is required system wide.
The Defender works on any code that is networked within PHP-Fusion giving you shortcuts to the things you do frequently to secure your sanitization.

At the heart of the new PHP-Fusion 9, new functions are developed to react as validation sensors and fully integrated into the Defender engine which will measure the changes of
each and every input fields. These measurements are then combined with a pre-sanitized values from the sensors to provide fast, accurate and continous response and
enhance itself automatically with Themes to provide beautiful form feedback.

All single process is all done a fraction of a second.

The Defender, is a clear example of how applications and core software can be developed together to work in a singular experience.


<h2>PHP-Fusion Dynamics</h2>

With the introduction of Bootstrap responsive framework, a single website have been transformed to adapt and is capable to become a multi device platform.

For a truly powerful developing experience, we've developed an entirely new Dynamic field input technology deeply integrated into PHP-Fusion 9's architecture.

To produce a rich User Interface experience,  â€” we've enhanced field creation simplicity by transforming short codes -- into a range of responsive fields. This enables tools and interaction that have been impossibly before.

While a sophisticated field on a typical Content Management System require a developer to write ten or more lines of codes, the PHP-Fusion 9 can reach about the same in just a few words, and it can be customised just as quickly. 

This allows developer to create more distinct applications in just less than a tenth of what was required previously.

PHP-Fusion 9 continues to transform the way we do things in a whole new scale, however invented and designed.

<h2>Theming Framework</h2>

Driving the new system's high performance, is the all new theme framework. It was specifically designed to for PHP-Fusion 9 and to meet the demands of a much larger user audience. It's simple administration interface lets you do, and see more. And it's precise configuribility allow you new form of theme editing while enhancing the capabilities of installed themes package. 

With people using PHP-Fusion in different ways, PHP-Fusion 9 is redeveloped to allow 3rd party developers to develop and design products that meet the demands of specific requirements. This is the first PHP-Fusion we've developed to feature a administration user interface, while enhancing the capabilities of PHP-Fusion 9.

To give theme frameworks a greater level of customizability - we've completely re-engineered the official system into Infusions, redevelop all its subsystems to be deflated with hierarchy, and doubling all information ouput.
All with template support dynamically rendering unique designs and contents - It's actually the most advanced system we've made.
