Architecture?
----------------
Panel interface, to drag and drop into panels. Otherwise, Panels administration interface in Infusions / Theme.

 Do i add front end drag and drop?
 
 To note:
 
     Delete panels from templates and site links administration as well ?
     do until conflict, do not delete anything.
     panels must obey
     theme engine must be deleted and replaced into composer
     lets do drag and drop sockets. 
     
Panels use back panels.

In custom page, you can create and drag drop to containers.

Layout need to select types of layout? no. because we do by fluid basis.

So where to change Layout? Click Layout, then the whole container will have boxes

Page Content at default basic remains same. Adds extra rows and additional information into DB_PAGE_CONTENT
